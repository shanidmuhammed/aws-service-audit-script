- RDS
- DynamoDB
- Lambda
- EBS

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- **AWS CLI** must be installed.
- **AWS credentials** must be configured using `aws configure`.

##  Usage:
````bash
./aws_resources_list.sh <region> <service_name>
````
##  Example:

./aws_resources_list.sh us-east-1 ec2
````
This command lists all EC2 instances in the us-east-1 region.

````
Listing EC2 Instances in us-east-1

    "Reservations": [
        {
            "Instances": [
                {
                    "InstanceId": "i-0123456789abcdef0",
                    ...
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
